Here we present our amazon-meta.txt parser along with our 2020-2021 Graph Theory project.
The project pdf is included. For more details please refer to "group7_metadata_analyzer.ipynb" file.

Also for parsing operations which should be useful to anyone working on amazon-meta, 
please check "amazon_metada_parser.ipynb" for useful comments and explanations.

Feel free to email us or write me directly about the parser and the project. We will be glad to answering your questions.

Note that "amazon-meta.txt" file should be included to the project, before any calculations.
In addition to that some operations might take a lot of time, including the parsing of the whole "amazon-meta.txt".

We would like to express our gratitude to our professor Islem Rekik with her support on the project.
