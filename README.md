Here we present our amazon-meta.txt parser along with our 2020-2021 Graph Theory project.
For more details please refer to **"group7_metadata_analyzer.ipynb"** file.

Also for parsing operations which should be useful to anyone working on amazon-meta, 
please check **"amazon_metada_parser.ipynb"** for useful comments and explanations.

Feel free to email us or write me directly about the parser and the project. We will be glad to answer your questions.

_Note that "amazon-meta.txt" file should be included to the project, before any calculations._

In addition to that some operations might take a lot of time, including the parsing of the whole "amazon-meta.txt".

We would like to express our gratitude to our professor **Islem Rekik** with her support on the project.
